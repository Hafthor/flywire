Download connectome data from https://flywire.ai. You'll need most of the codex files, except the two biggest ones (connections_no_threshold and sk_lod1_783_healed). Should be 16 files. Put those files somewhere (leave them as .csv.gz) and point Program.Path to the folder. It loads the model into memory, but nothing happens at the moment. What should I make it do?
